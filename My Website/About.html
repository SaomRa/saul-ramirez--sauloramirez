     <p>Saul Omar Ramirez was born In Jamaica Queens, New York in 1979. Having a rich
     imagination, he was influenced a great deal by fiction and fantasy. From cartoons
     such as He-Man and Ninja Turtles, to other entertainment media like comic books,
     video games, sports entertainment and hip hop culture, all had a lasting effect
     on this impressionable youth. Naturally Omar, as he likes to be called, incorporated
     many of these influences into his art. Initially starting out almost exclusively as
     an illustrator, he branched out into other forms of visual art such as sculpting,
     digital, film and animation, and most recently photography and print.
     <br><br>
     Omar currently works for the DOE as a Paraprofessional. Having daily access to the
     minds of children has inspired him to make art geared toward children. Children,
     having rich imaginations themselves, are the perfect source of material for much of
     his art. He also works part time as a free lance graphic designer and is currently
     working on a fictional story for a graphic novel and you tube animation.
     As an active artist, Omar has participated in various events such as an Independent Urban
     and Fantasy Art pop-up exhibit in October of 2017 and the Baltimore 2015 Comicon Convention
     as a freelance artist.
     <br>Omar still resides in the great city of New York, near to his birthplace in Queens
     Village.</p>
